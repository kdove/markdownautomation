# Unit 09 Node.js and ES6+ Homework: Good README Generator

Create a command-line application that dynamically generates a README.md from a user's input. The application will be invoked with the following command:

```sh
node index.js
```

The user will be prompted for their GitHub username, which will be used to make a call to the GitHub API to retrieve their email and profile image. They will then be prompted with questions about their project.

The README will be populated with the following:

* At least one badge
* Project title
* Description
* Table of Contents
* Installation
* Usage
* License
* Contributing
* Tests
* Questions
  * User GitHub profile picture
  * User GitHub email

Following the [common templates for user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story#Common_templates), we can frame this challenge as follows:

```
AS A developer

I WANT a README generator

SO THAT I can easily put together a good README for a new project
```

Refer to the [Good README guide](../../01-HTML-Git-CSS/04-Supplemental/Good-README-Guide/README.md).

## Business Context

When preparing a report for stakeholders, it is important to have up-to-date information about members of the development team. Rather than navigating to each team member's GitHub profile, a command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of profiles in PDF format.

## Minimum Requirements

* Functional, deployed application.

* GitHub repository with a unique name and a README describing project.
<!-- Spec requirement; 'initialize repository and create a README.MD with a unique name' 
Completed per Spec Requirement on 02/23/2020-->

* The generated README includes a bio image from the user's GitHub profile.  [COMPLETE]

* The generated README includes the user's email. [COMPLETE]

* The generated README includes the following sections: 

* The generated README includes 1 badge that's specific to the repository. [COMPLETE]

```
GIVEN the developer has a GitHub profile and a repository

WHEN prompted for the developer's GitHub username and repo specific information

* THEN a README for the repo is generated. [COMPLETED]
```

## Commit Early and Often

One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important:

* Your commit history allows you to revert your code base in the event that you need to return to a previous state. [COMPLETED]

Follow these guidelines for committing:

* Make single-purpose commits for related changes to ensure a clean, manageable history. If you are fixing two issues, make two commits. [COMPLETED]

* Write descriptive, meaningful commit messages so that you and anyone else looking at your repository can easily understand its history. [COMPLETED]
<!-- Spec Requirement; please see deliverable referenced in the following commits "master b0ef752",  -->

* Don't commit half-done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!). [COMPLETED]
<!-- Spec requirement; 'Don't commit half-done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!)'.
All commits are tested and functional prior to commiting -->
* Test your application before you commit to ensure functionality at every step in the development process. [COMPLETED]

We would like you to have more than 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often! [WILL GET TO THIS BEFORE THE CLASS IS OVER]

## Submission on BCS

You are required to submit the following:

* An animated GIF demonstrating the app functionality [THIS IS A SCREEN RECODING DEMONSTRATING THE WORKING APP]

* A generated PDF of your GitHub profile [OKAY I WILL SUBMIT THIS]

* The URL of the GitHub repository [COMPLETED]
